# Lab-26 Cowsay-app *meowsay*

## Description
Angular section has one module called "meowApp" which contains a template and controller. The template, called "meowSay", is a div containing a title with the words "Meow, meow, meow", a text input for the user, and a pretext section below containing the string, "meowmix meowmix please deliver."

The controller builds the title section on loadup of the website, "onInit" and leaves the userinput section blank. When a user types in new input into the userinput field, the meowmix text is replaced with whatever the user types in. Cow image was changed to a kitty to properly fit the theme of the text.
